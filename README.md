# Excel-Interactive-Dashboard



I have created a dynamic and interactive Excel dashboard using the cookie company data. The dashboard showcases important information and various key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be derived from the data. The main Excel tools used are pivot tables and pivot charts.

Here is an overview of the different components of the dashboard:

1. Data Sheet:
   - Contains the data for the cookie company, including columns for country, revenue, profit, and other parameters.
   - Data has been filtered to include only the year 2020.

2. Convert the Data into a Table:
   - The data has been converted into a table format for easier manipulation and analysis.

3. Profit by Country and Cookie Type:
   - A pivot table has been created with country as the row labels, cookie name as the column labels, and profit as the values.
   - A bar pivot chart has been applied to visualize the profit distribution across countries and cookie types.

4. Units Sold Each Month:
   - Another pivot table has been created with month as the row labels and units sold as the values.
   - A line chart has been applied to visualize the monthly trend in units sold.

5. Product Wise Units Sold:
   - A pivot table has been created with the product as the row labels and units sold as the values.
   - A donut chart has been applied to visualize the distribution of units sold by product.

6. Monthly Profit:
   - A pivot table has been created with month as the row labels and profit as the values.
   - A line chart has been applied to visualize the monthly profit trend.

7. Slicer:
   - A slicer has been inserted and connected to all the pivot tables.
   - This allows for easy filtering and selection of data based on different criteria.
